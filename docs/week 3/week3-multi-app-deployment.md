# 📦 Week 3: Multi-App Deployment, Routing, and Scaling

---

## 🎯 Objective

Deploy multiple applications on the Kubernetes cluster, expose them externally using Ingress rules, and perform basic manual scaling to simulate real-world application management.

---

## 🛠 Environment

| Component               | Details                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Kubernetes Distribution  | K3s v1.32.3+k3s1                |
| Nodes                    | 1 control-plane, 2 worker nodes |
| Ingress Controller       | Traefik (bundled with K3s)      |
| OS Platform              | Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS              |
| Tools                    | kubectl, nano, (Optional: Helm) |

---

## 📝 Plan for Week 3

- Deploy a second simple application (`whoami`) alongside nginx.
- Create ClusterIP Services for both applications.
- Define separate Ingress routes for each app:
  - `nginx.lab.local`
  - `whoami.lab.local`
- Verify external browser access for both apps.
- Perform manual scaling:
  - Increase and decrease the number of nginx Pods.
  - Increase and decrease the number of whoami Pods.
- (Optional Bonus) Deploy and access the Kubernetes Dashboard.
