## ðŸ“‚ Deployment Manifests

**nginx-deployment.yaml**
Wrote and applied the YAML file to deploy two nginx pods in the cluster using a Deployment resource.  
*(file in /manifests)*

**nginx-service.yaml**
Wrote and applied the YAML file to create a ClusterIP Service that provides internal access and load balances traffic across the nginx pods.  
*(file in /manifests)*

**nginx-ingress.yaml**
Wrote and applied the YAML file to define an Ingress rule that exposes the nginx Service externally through the Traefik Ingress Controller.  
*(file in /manifests)*
